# Term Scanner

## Function:
This repository will take the text of a terms and conditions agreement and return the most important/suspect clauses for the user to examine themselves without wasting time to parse through the whole mess of legal jargon.  The repository will scan for clausal structure and phrasing that human review of pre-existong agreements has labelled worrisome and then organizes them into the categories described in important_clauses.md.
