  //scan for: information clauses (where information goes), often characterized by "Sharing of Information"
  //scan for: "Third Parties and affiliations"
  //scan for: "Opt out"
  //scan for: section title: "arbitration"
  //scan for: sections written in all caps (these tend to be important, regardless of their contents)
  //scan for: "Disclaimer of other content" (often used to slip in things which aren't part of what the user expects)
  //I think there have to be some specific things to scan for only in all-caps sections; American Law says that important things have to be conspicuously labelled, and comapnies respond by having HUGE LONG LINES OF ALL CAPS TEXT
  //definitely need to have a potentially questionable category for things like sections beginning with "limitations" and "responsibilities"
