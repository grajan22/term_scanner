Possible approaches:

* Make a rubric and manually grade different Terms of Services. Pros: you get to establish your own criteria and it's easy to welcome new contributors; cons: difficult to scale, limited scope for lesser-known sites. 
* Use NLP to isolate features and figure out a danger value. Pros: this allows you to build/explore this issue from scratch; cons: potentially might not be accurate or may take a long time to implement. 
* Grab info from [TOS;dr](https://edit.tosdr.org/) and make it into a chrome extension or real-time app. Pros: quick and easy; cons: not building the algorithm yourself. [Here's](https://edit.tosdr.org/cases/146) an example case; you can isolate by issue rather than service, which may be helpful.
* Make a list of phrases and check via an if-statement for matches. Pros: quick, easy, and not difficult from a technological perspective; cons: may not recognize difficult language in Terms and Conditions due to small phrasing differences, since there isn't a single template.
